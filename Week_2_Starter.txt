💡 **Portfolio Project Idea I'm Exploring:**

I'm considering building "MedStudy Voice" - a medical document audio companion app that converts PDFs, Word docs, and study materials into high-quality audio with proper medical terminology pronunciation. The use case: medical students and healthcare professionals could listen to dense medical documents during commutes instead of only being able to read them at a desk.

This seems like a strong Healthcare AI portfolio piece because it:
- Solves a real healthcare education pain point
- Demonstrates AI integration (TTS, document processing)  
- Shows understanding of healthcare workflows
- Could be built with no-code/low-code tools (Bubble.io + ElevenLabs API)

Would love thoughts on whether this type of project would be valuable for a Healthcare AI Implementation Specialist portfolio, or if I should focus on different types of automation projects first.

Thanks again for the guidance!
