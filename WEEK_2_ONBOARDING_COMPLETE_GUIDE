## 📁 PART 3: WEEK 2 LOGISTICS

**GREAT QUESTIONS! Let me clarify everything!**

---

### **Q1: Do I create a new Claude project/conversation for Week 2?**

**ANSWER: YES! Here's why and how:**

**WHY NEW CONVERSATION:**
- ✅ Fresh context window (this conversation is getting long!)
- ✅ Clean slate for Week 2 content
- ✅ Better performance (shorter context = faster responses)
- ✅ Organized by week (easier to reference later)

**FOLDER STRUCTURE - STAY THE SAME:**
```
E:\Mindbridge health care\     ← KEEP THIS!
├── scripts/                   ← All your existing scripts
├── reports/                   ← All your generated reports  
├── Reference Sheets/          ← All 6 reference docs
├── data/                      ← We'll add this in Week 2!
├── logs/                      ← We'll add this in Week 2!
├── .gitignore                 ← Keep this!
├── patients.csv               ← Keep this!
└── README.md                  ← Keep this!
```

**HOW TO START WEEK 2:**

2. **First message:** "Good morning! Monday, February 17, 2026. Starting Week 2 of MindBridge Health Healthcare AI Engineer training. My project folder is E:\Mindbridge health care"
3. **The team will welcome you and start Week 2!**

**IMPORTANT:** Same folder, new conversation!

### **Q2: What about this current conversation?**

**KEEP IT FOR REFERENCE!**
